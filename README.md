This is a music visualizer program I built to "express" music as a visible form of energy (colors, motion, shapes). I wanted to create cloud of energy that responds to the musical content and captures the "feeling" behind the music.

This music visualizer uses statistical analysis techniques and machine learning to process audio data. It learns the music as it plays and the visual elements will "dance" in a more structured way as it moves alongside the music.

Note: use Pyglet version 1.5.27 instead of latest Pyglet package
